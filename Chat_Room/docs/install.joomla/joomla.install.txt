***  Requirements ***
*********************
	It is recommend that you use an FTP client for uploading and changing
	permissions on files and directories.  For assistance in obtaining and
	using an FTP client please visit http://help.x7chat.com.

	X7 Chat requires that you have a properly configured HTTP server which
	supports PHP Version 4.2.2* or higher.  X7 Chat also requires some type 
	of database server.  X7 Chat provides built in support for the following
	database servers:
		- MySql 3.23.54* or higher;
		
	Additional modules may be available at http://x7chat.com that will allow
	you to use different database servers.  Instructions for installing 
	these should come with them.
		
	If you are unable to find a module for your database, you may also 
	program your own  database module for X7 Chat to use.  Intermediate to 
	advanced knowledge of PHP is required to do this.  Support is not 
	provided, but documentation is available at http://help.x7chat.com under
	the developer section.
	
	
	* X7 Chat may function properly with some lower versions but Tech 
	  Support will not be provided to people who do not meet these system 
	  requirements.

*********************
***  Pre-Install ****
*********************
	X7 Chat will automatically detect Joomla and configure itself to use the same
	database as Joomla.  If you are an experienced user you may configure X7 Chat to
	use a different database during installation.  Creating a database beforehand
	is not necessary.
	
*********************
***  Installation ***
*********************
	Follow these steps to install X7 Chat:
	
		Step 1) Upload all of the files and directories included with this 
		download to your webserver.  You should put them in a new directory
		on your server.  This new directory *MUST* be directly inside the Joomla 
		directory.  After uploading you need to be able to access the chat room by 
		going to http://yoursite.com/Joomladirectory/x7chatdirectory/install.php.  
		Everything should be uploaded in BINARY mode**.
		
		WARNING: X7 Chat should NOT be placed into the Joomla modules directory,
		placing X7 Chat in the modules directory will cause integration to fail.
		
		Step 2) CHMOD 777* the following files and directorys:
					- /logs/
					- /mods/
					- /uploads/
					- /config.php
					
		Step 3) Visit http://yourwebsite.com/Joomladirectory/x7chatdirectory/install.php.
		Of course you must replace "yourwebsite.com" with the actual address of
		your site, "/Joomladirectory" with the actual path to your board.  And
		"x7chatdirectory" with the actual path to the X7 Chat directory.
		The install.php file will guide you through the rest of the installation 
		process.  While running the installation file it will automatically configure 
		itself to integrate with Joomla, leave the default settings on step 1 in order 
		for this integration to work properly.
		
		Step 4) Follow these directions to add a link to the chat room on your Joomla.
			1) Enter your Joomla admin panel and click the Menu Manager button.
			2) Press the button under the "Menu Items" column next to mainmenu (or
			whatever menu you want Chat to appear under)
			3) Press the "New" button.
			4) Choose "Link - URL" under the Links section and press "Next"
			5) Enter "Chat" or another appropriate name into the Name box,
			in the Link box put "./x7chat", but replace "x7chat" with the name
			of the directory that you put X7 Chat in.  Choose anything you want
			for the remaining options and press Save.
		
		Assistance) If you need assistance with these instructions please
		visit http://help.x7chat.com.
		
		* If using a Windows server then the file needs to be made
		writeable by everyone.  After installation set the file so it is
		no longer writeable to everyone.
		
		** This is usually the default setting for FTP programs.  If you don't
		know how to change it then chances are its already on BINARY.  Images and 
		sound files that are included with X7 Chat will not work unless they
		are uploaded in BINARY mode.
		
*********************
***  Post-Install ***
*********************
	After installation you MUST deleted the install.php file.  If you do not
	anybody can get administrator access.
	
	For added security you may change the permissions on config.php to their
	former values.
