*** How to display the number of users in the chat room on another page ***
***************************************************************************

This documentation will explain how to display the number of users in your chat room
on another page of your website.  The page does not have to be written in PHP and no
PHP programming knowledge is necessary to set up this display counter.

This method requires that the PHP GD library be installed.  Whether it is installed or
not is not something that you can control, so if it isn't installed then you won't be
able to do the following.  To see if you have the GD library installed visit
http://yoursite.com/x7chat2directory/online.php, you will either see a number or a message
telling you that the GD library is not installed.  If you see the number then you can
continue this tutorial.

The number that you saw above is the number of people who have been in your chat room in
the past 30 seconds, or who are currently in the chat room.  Adding this number to your
website is very simple, add the following HTML code anywhere in your site and the number
will display there, of course you will need to edit the path to make it point to your
X7 Chat installation.

*** Customizing ***
*******************
You can customize the size and color of the display so that it matches your website.  To
do this you must add "arguments" onto the end of the image URL.  Arguments are seperated
by &'s and are in the form key=value.  After the list of arguments I will show you an
example if you do not understand.


| Key		| Explanation					| Example (default value)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| size_x	| The width of the image			| size_x=50 (automatic*)
| size_y	| The height of the image			| size_y=50 (automatic*)
| font_size	| The size of the font				| font_size=12 (12)
| red		| Amount of red in the font color (0-255)	| red=0 (0)
| blue		| Amount of blue in the font color (0-255)	| blue=100 (0)
| green		| Amount of green in the font color (0-255)	| green=255 (0)
| bg_red	| Amount of red in the background (0-255)	| bg_red=255 (255)
| bg_blue	| Amount of blue in the background (0-255)	| bg_blue=100 (255)
| bg_green	| Amount of green in the background (0-255)	| bg_green=0 (255)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* If size_x and/or size_y is not specified it will be calculated automatically to best fit.

Let's say I want a slightly larger font size then the default 12, I would use

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, let's say I want to keep that larger font size and I want a yellow background
