***  Information  ***
*********************
	Use these instructions to upgrade from a X7 Chat 1.3.6 to X7 Chat 2.
	
	You cannot upgrade from an X7 Chat version older than 1.3.6, please
	download X7 Chat 1.3.6 from the site and upgrade to that before
	upgrading to X7 Chat 2 using these instructions.
	
	Note: This upgrade script is more of an import script to import your
	data from Version 1 to Version 2.  If you need any help understanding
	the process please send us an E-Mail or post on the forum.
	
	It is highly recommended that you make a backup of your database first.
	
*********************
***  Pre-Upgrade ****
*********************
	Open your X7 Chat 1.3.6 config.php file and write down the values of
	$SERVER['TBL_PREFIX'] and $SERVER['AUTH'].
	
	Delete the old files from X7 Chat 1.3.6 including config.php.
	
	Upload the new files from X7 Chat 2.0.0 and follow the directions in
	install.txt to install X7 Chat 2.0.0.  We simply need a blank installation
	of Version 2 to set up the Version 2 database for the upgrade script.
	Running the Version 2 installer is the fastest way to do this.
	
	IMPORTANT NOTICE
	DO NOT USE THE SAME TABLE PREFIX WHEN YOU ARE INSTALLING VERSION 2.  YOU
	MUST NOT OVERWRITE THE VERSION 1 DATABASE ENTRIES, SO MAKE SURE YOU CHOOSE
	A DIFFERENT TABLE PREFIX.
	
*****************************
***  Upgrade Instructions ***
*****************************
	Visit http://yoursite.com/x7chat/upgradev1.php in your browser and follow
	the instructions.  If the Auth variable that you wrote down from the
	1.3.6 config file is 'plain', then you should check the box that says
	"convert passwords to MD5", otherwise do not check the box.
	
*********************
***  Post-Upgrade ***
*********************
	After upgrading you MUST deleted the install.php and upgradev1.php files.
	If you do not anybody can get administrator access.
